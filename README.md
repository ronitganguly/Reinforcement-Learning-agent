# Reinforcement-Learning-agent
# Introduction
In this assignment, I will provide a custom map to the 3 agents: a) Reinforcement Learning agent(RL agent), Simple agent(A Star agent), and a random senseless agent for finding the goal. Additionally, the map has 8 different versions for 8X8 map and 4 different versions for a 4X4 map. And at the end I will compare and contrast all of them and provide a conclusion. 

# The environement is similar to OpenAI gym's "Frozen Lake" where there are two types: 8X8 states, 4X4 states maze.
